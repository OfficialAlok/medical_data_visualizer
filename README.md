# Medical Data Visualizer

## Project Overview
This project aims to visualize and analyze medical examination data using Python's powerful data science libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. By leveraging these tools, we can gain valuable insights into the dataset and potentially identify trends or patterns.

## Dataset
The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. I used the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

## Visualization Techniques

- **Heatmaps:** Used to show the correlation between different medical metrics. This helps identify strong positive or negative relationships.

- **Catplot (Categorical Plot);** Used to visualize and compare the distribution of categorical data across different groups. It provides insights into various categorical variables such as cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking status, and more.

### Analysis Techniques

- **Correlation Analysis:** Identifies relationships between different medical metrics to understand how they are interrelated.

- **GroupBy:** Used to aggregate data and perform summary statistics to uncover patterns and insights within the data.

- **Quantile:** Used to filter outliers and focus on the central distribution of the data by considering specific quantiles.
